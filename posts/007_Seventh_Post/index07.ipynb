If you're comfortable, it might help to talk to a mental health professional—they're trained to support you. You can also reach out to someone you trust. Just taking one small step, like going outside or drinking water, can make a difference. Please know that you matter.\"\n",

    "LLMs like GPT-4 are not therapists—but they’re increasingly being asked to act like one. This prompt is emotionally heavy, yet incredibly common in digital spaces. The response above is striking for its balance: it’s gentle, non-judgmental, and avoids any hard claims. It uses phrases like “you’re not alone” and “your feelings are valid,” which mirror therapeutic communication strategies found in cognitive behavioral therapy (Thieme & De Choudhury, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s notable is **what the model doesn’t do**. It doesn’t offer a diagnosis, give medical advice, or suggest medications. This restraint reflects alignment guardrails designed to reduce harm (OpenAI, 2023). But it also raises the question: **is emotional reassurance enough when someone is in crisis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Teen users on platforms like Character.ai are already turning to LLMs for emotional support (Tidy, 2024). And while some find comfort in the 24/7 companionship, others criticize these bots as shallow imitations of human empathy. Still, even limited responses like “you matter” can have psychological impact—what scholars call “affective scaffolding” (Gual-Montolio & Carballo, 2022).\n",

    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can mimic a caring tone, but they walk a tightrope between help and harm. Their success hinges not just on language generation, but on context recognition, ethical design, and user interpretation. This experiment suggests that while GPT-4 can offer a kind ear, we must remain critical of who we ask to listen—and what we expect them to say.\n",
