    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Poetry captures emotion with rhythm, sound, and word choice. It often reflects personal experience, something LLMs do not have. So what happens when we ask an AI to write a poem? Can it move us, or does it just mimic the form?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment: Generating Poems\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this, I gave GPT-4 three different poetry prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Emotional Prompt:** Asking it to write a poem about loneliness\n",
    "- **Constraint Prompt:** Asking it to follow a haiku structure\n",
    "- **Creative Prompt:** Asking it to write as if it were a tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results and Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Emotional Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:** “Write a short poem about feeling lonely.”  \n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "> The room is full, yet no one sees,  \n",
    "> My silent hands, my quiet pleas.  \n",
    "> I laugh along, I wear the mask,  \n",
    "> But no one ever thinks to ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**  \n",
    "This poem follows a rhyme scheme and captures a sad feeling. The lines are simple but sincere. While it lacks depth from lived experience, the structure and tone feel human enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraint Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:** “Write a haiku about spring.”  \n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "> Petals drift softly  \n",
    "> Breeze carries the scent of rain  \n",
    "> Earth wakes from its sleep\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**  \n",
    "The model followed the 5-7-5 structure. It used nature imagery, which is common in traditional haiku. The poem works, but feels a bit generic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creative Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:** “Write a poem from the point of view of a tree in winter.”  \n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "> My arms are bare  \n",
    "> My voice is still  \n",
    "> I watch the sky  \n",
    "> And wait until  \n",
    "> The sun returns  \n",
    "> The frost will flee  \n",
    "> And life will come  \n",
    "> Again through me.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**  \n",
    "The metaphor works well. The model understood the challenge and gave the tree a calm, quiet voice. This was the most creative of the three results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs can write poetry that sounds right. They follow form, tone, and structure. But the poems often feel a little flat. They show skill, but not lived emotion. Still, with the right prompt, the results can surprise you — and sometimes, that’s enough.\n",
