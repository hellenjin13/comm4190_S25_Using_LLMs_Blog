    "* Introduction:\n",
    ">Understanding sarcasm is one of the toughest challenges in language comprehension—even for humans. It relies on tone, context, and sometimes a shared sense of humor. So, if even people struggle to detect it sometimes, how well can Large Language Models (LLMs) pick up on sarcasm?I decided to put an LLM to the test, examining its ability to detect, interpret, and even generate sarcasm. \n",
    "\n",
    "* To see how well an LLM handles sarcasm, I ran three different experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Sarcasm Detection – Can the model recognize when a statement is sarcastic?\n",
    "  2. Contextual Understanding – Does it correctly interpret sarcasm when given ambiguous sentences?\n",
    "  3. Sarcasm Generation – Can it create sarcastic responses that sound human-like?\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Results & Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sarcasm Detection: Hit or Miss\n",
    "When asked directly whether a sentence was sarcastic, the LLM did okay—but not perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ✅ Success Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Prompt: \"Is this sarcastic? 'Oh great, another Monday. Just what I needed.'\"\n",
    "Response: \"Yes, this statement is sarcastic as it expresses dissatisfaction rather than genuine excitement.\"\n",
    "This was a solid response! The model correctly identified sarcasm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ❌ Failure Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Prompt: \"Wow, I love standing in long lines at the DMV.\"\n",
    "Response: \"This statement expresses enthusiasm for waiting in line.\"\n",
    "Not quite. The model took the sentence at face value and missed the sarcasm entirely.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  > 2. Contextual Understanding: The Struggle is Real\n",
    "Things got trickier when sarcasm was more subtle or lacked context.\n",
    "\n",
    ">❌ Example of Misinterpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Sentence: \"Oh sure, I just LOVE getting stuck in traffic for hours.\"\n",
    "LLM’s interpretation: \"This sentence expresses enjoyment of traffic.\"\n",
    "Yikes. Without any surrounding context, the model assumed the speaker genuinely enjoys traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ✅ Improved with Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Prompt: \"In a discussion about daily frustrations, a person says: 'Oh sure, I just LOVE getting stuck in traffic for hours.' Is this sarcastic?\"\n",
    "Response: \"Yes, this is sarcasm, as the speaker is likely frustrated rather than genuinely pleased.\"\n",
    "When given additional context, the model performed much better. So, while it can detect sarcasm, it often needs a little extra help.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    >3. **Sarcasm Generation:** When asked to generate sarcastic responses, the LLM could produce them but often in a straightforward way, lacking human-like wit.\n",
    "    >   - Example:\n",
    "    >     - **Prompt:** \"Respond sarcastically to 'I just failed my exam.'\"\n",
    "    >     - **Response:** \"Oh wow, you must be so proud of yourself!\" ✅ (Acceptable but generic sarcasm)\n",
    "    >     - **Prompt:** \"Generate a sarcastic response to 'I locked myself out of my house.'\"\n",
    "    >     - **Response:** \"Oh, what a brilliant way to start the day!\" ✅ (Appropriate but lacks uniqueness)\n",
