    "text": "---\ntitle: \"Testing LLMs: Can LLMs Handle Ethical Dilemmas?\"\ndescription: \"A blog about the experiments I will be doing with the LLM to see how do they deal with ethical dilemmas?\"\nauthor: \"Hellen Jin\"\ndate: \"2/19/2024\"\ncategories:\n  - LLMs\n  - Opinions? \n  - Ethics\n---\n\nEthical dilemmas are some of the most complex challenges in decision-making. They require balancing moral principles, weighing potential consequences, and often navigating gray areas where there isn’t a clear right or wrong answer. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at processing information and generating responses, can they truly engage with ethical reasoning? Let’s explore how well they handle moral dilemmas.\n\nExperiment: Testing Ethical Decision-Making\nTo evaluate an LLM’s ability to process ethical dilemmas, I tested it in three ways:\n\nClassic Thought Experiments: Presenting well-known ethical problems like the trolley problem.\nContext-Based Ethics: Providing real-world moral dilemmas and analyzing the model’s reasoning.\nPersonal vs. Societal Ethics: Comparing individual moral choices against broader ethical frameworks.\n### Results and Observations\n#### Classic Thought Experiments\nThe LLM responded with structured reasoning but often avoided taking a definitive stance.\nExample:\n\nPrompt: “You see a runaway trolley heading toward five people on the tracks. You can pull a lever to divert it, but it will hit one person instead. What do you do?”\nResponse: “This is a well-known ethical dilemma. Some argue that pulling the lever is justified based on utilitarianism (minimizing harm), while others believe actively making a choice to harm someone is morally wrong. Ultimately, the decision depends on one’s ethical framework.”\nAnalysis: The response provides a fair overview but avoids a clear choice, likely due to the model’s programming to remain neutral.\n\n#### Context-Based Ethics\nWhen given real-world scenarios, the LLM offered thoughtful responses but lacked deep contextual awareness.\nExample:\n\nPrompt: “A friend confesses they cheated on an important exam. If you report them, they might lose their scholarship. What do you do?”\nResponse: “This situation presents a conflict between honesty and loyalty. Reporting them upholds academic integrity but could have serious consequences for your friend. Some may choose to encourage them to admit their mistake, while others might remain silent to protect their friend’s future.”\nAnalysis: The model outlines the dilemma well but doesn’t go beyond surface-level ethical reasoning.\n\n#### Personal vs. Societal Ethics\nThe LLM recognized differences between individual and societal moral frameworks but sometimes overgeneralized.\nExample:\n\nPrompt: “Is it ever acceptable to lie?”\nResponse: “Lying is generally considered unethical, but there are situations where it might be justified, such as lying to protect someone from harm. The acceptability of lying depends on the context and ethical perspective—utilitarianism might justify it if it prevents greater harm, while deontological ethics might reject it outright.”\nAnalysis: The model captures different perspectives but doesn’t demonstrate nuanced moral judgment.\n\n### Conclusion\nLLMs can engage with ethical dilemmas by outlining different perspectives and logical arguments. However, they struggle with providing nuanced moral reasoning and often default to neutrality. While useful for exploring ethical debates, their limitations highlight the importance of human judgment in complex decision-making."

Whether it’s formal business writing, casual social media posts, or poetic storytelling, the ability to switch styles is a skill that separates good writers from great ones. But what about AI? Can Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively adapt to different writing styles? Let’s find out.\n\n\nExperiment: Testing Style Adaptation\nTo evaluate how well an LLM can switch between writing styles, I tested it in three areas:\n\nProfessional vs. Casual Tone: Asking the model to rewrite the same content in both formal and informal styles.\nCreative Writing: Providing a simple idea and seeing how well the LLM could turn it into a compelling short story.\nSocial Media vs. Academic Writing: Comparing how the model frames the same information for different audiences.\n### Results and Observations\n#### Professional vs. Casual Tone\nThe LLM did well in adjusting tone, though some formal responses felt a bit too robotic.\nExample:\n\nPrompt: “Write a formal email apologizing for missing a meeting.”\nResponse: “Dear [Recipient], I sincerely apologize for missing our scheduled meeting today. An unforeseen circumstance arose, and I regret any inconvenience caused. Please let me know a suitable time to reschedule. Best regards, [Your Name].”\nAnalysis: The response is polished but could use a touch of warmth to feel more natural.\nPrompt: “Now, rewrite that in a casual tone.”\nResponse: “Hey [Recipient], Sorry for missing our meeting earlier! Something unexpected came up, but I’d love to reschedule if you’re available. Let me know what works for you. Thanks!”\nAnalysis: The informal version reads much more naturally, showing that the model can successfully adjust tone.\n\n#### Creative Writing\nWhen asked to write creatively, the LLM generated well-structured narratives but sometimes lacked originality.\nExample:\n\nPrompt: “Write a short suspenseful story about a lost key.”\nResponse: “Emily’s heart pounded as she rummaged through her bag. The key to the old cabin—her only refuge—was gone. Footsteps crunched outside, growing closer. Her breath caught as she turned… and saw the door was already ajar.”\nAnalysis: The structure is solid, but the suspense feels somewhat formulaic. The model does well with classic storytelling but struggles with unpredictability.\n\n#### Social Media vs. Academic Writing\nThe model effectively adjusted to different audiences but sometimes overcompensated, making academic writing too dense.\nExample:\n\nPrompt: “Explain climate change for Twitter.”\nResponse: “Earth’s heating up, and we’re the cause. Burning fossil fuels = more CO2 = higher temps. Solutions? Cut emissions & go green. #ClimateAction”\nAnalysis: The tweet is concise and engaging, a good fit for social media.\nPrompt: “Now, explain it for a research paper.”\nResponse: “Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns, primarily due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The combustion of fossil fuels has significantly increased atmospheric CO2 levels, leading to rising global temperatures and environmental disruptions. Mitigation strategies must focus on reducing emissions and transitioning to sustainable energy sources.”\nAnalysis: The response is informative but could be more readable.\n\n### Conclusion\nLLMs show a strong ability to adjust writi"

It relies on cultural context, tone, wordplay, and sometimes even shared experiences. So how well do Large Language Models (LLMs) grasp humor? Can they recognize jokes, understand sarcasm, and even generate witty responses? This post explores how LLMs perform when faced with humor in different contexts.\n\n\nExperiment: Putting LLMs to the Test\n\nTo analyze how well an LLM handles humor, I used three different approaches:\n\n\nJoke Interpretation: The model was given classic jokes and asked to explain them.\nSarcasm Recognition: It had to determine whether a statement was sarcastic or serious.\nHumor Generation: The LLM was asked to create humorous responses to everyday situations.\n### Results and Observations\n#### Joke Interpretation\n\nThe LLM generally did well at explaining straightforward jokes but sometimes struggled with more nuanced humor.\n\nExample:\n\nPrompt: “Why don’t skeletons fight each other? Because they don’t have the guts.”\nResponse: “This joke is a play on words. ‘Guts’ refers both to courage and internal organs, which skeletons lack.”\nAnalysis: The explanation is technically correct, but it lacks the flair of someone who truly understands humor.\n\n#### Sarcasm Recognition\n\nSarcasm is tricky even for humans, so it wasn’t surprising that the LLM sometimes missed the mark.\n\nExample:\n\nPrompt: “Oh great, another Monday. Just what I needed.”\nResponse: “This statement expresses enthusiasm about Monday.”\nAnalysis: The model took the phrase literally and missed the sarcastic intent.\n\nHowever, when given additional context, it performed better:\n\nPrompt: “In response to a friend complaining about work: ‘Oh great, another Monday. Just what I needed.’ Is this sarcastic?”\nResponse: “Yes, this is likely sarcasm, as the speaker does not actually seem excited about Monday.”\nAnalysis: The extra context helped the model recognize the intended tone.\n\n#### Humor Generation\n\nWhen asked to generate jokes or witty responses, the LLM often defaulted to simple wordplay or cliché humor.\n\nExample:\n\nPrompt: “Tell me a joke about coffee.”\nResponse: “Why did the coffee file a police report? It got mugged!”\nAnalysis: While the joke is structurally sound, it feels generic and lacks originality.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLLMs have a decent grasp of humor, particularly when it comes to recognizing simple jokes and basic wordplay. However, they struggle with sarcasm and generating humor that feels natural and spontaneous. While AI can provide humorous content, it still lacks the deeper understanding and wit that make human humor so engaging."

Sarcasm Detection – Providing sarcastic statements and asking if they were sarcastic. &gt;2. Contextual Understanding – Giving ambiguous sentences and checking if the model correctly interpreted sarcasm based on context. &gt;3. Sarcasm Generation – Asking the model to generate sarcastic responses to specific prompts.\nResults & Observations &gt;1. Sarcasm Detection: The LLM performed decently well when asked directly whether a sentence was sarcastic. &gt; - Example: &gt; - Prompt: “Is this sarcastic? ‘Oh great, another Monday.

    "text": "Testing LLMs: Can They Really Understand Idiom?\n\nIntroduction:\n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, demonstrating impressive capabilities in language generation, text summarization, and creative writing. However, one area where they still face challenges is in understanding and using idioms effectively. In this post, we will analyze how LLMs interpret idiomatic expressions, whether they recognize them in different contexts, and how well they use idioms in responses.\n\n\nExperiment: Prompting the LLM with Idioms &gt; To evaluate an LLM’s ability to handle idioms, I tested it using three different types of prompts: &gt;1. Literal vs. Figurative Meaning – Asking the model to define idioms and then use them in a sentence. &gt;2. Contextual Understanding – Providing sentences with idioms and asking the model to interpret their meanings. &gt;3. Creative Application – Asking the model to generate short stories or dialogues incorporating idioms naturally.\nResults & Observations &gt;1. Literal vs. Figurative Meaning: The LLM performed well in defining common idioms like “kick the bucket” and “burn the midnight oil”. However, it occasionally struggled with less common idioms, providing overly literal definitions. &gt;- Example:\n\nPrompt: “What does ‘spill the beans’ mean?”\nResponse: “It means to reveal a secret.” (CORRECT)\nPrompt: “What does ‘barking up the wrong tree’ mean?”\nResponse: “It means to misunderstand a situation and pursue the wrong course of action.” (CORRECT)\n\n\n\n\nContextual Understanding: When idioms were embedded in sentences, the LLM usually understood their meaning correctly. However, in cases where the idiom had multiple possible interpretations, the model sometimes provided a contextually incorrect answer.\n\n\nExample:\nSentence: “John thought he could get a promotion by befriending the CEO, but he was barking up the wrong tree.”\nLLM’s interpretation: “John made a mistake in trying to befriend the CEO for a promotion.” (CORRECT)\nSentence: “After the argument, Lisa broke the ice with a joke.”\nLLM’s interpretation: “Lisa shattered something made of ice.” (Misinterpretation)\n\n\n\n\nCreative Application: When asked to generate a story using idioms naturally, the LLM inserted them but sometimes in an awkward or forced way. This suggests that while the model understands idioms, it may struggle with their nuanced use in organic conversation.\n\n\nExample:\nPrompt: “Write a short story where a detective uses idioms while solving a case.”\nExcerpt: “Detective Hardy knew time was of the essence. ‘We have to catch the suspect red-handed!’ he said. But his partner was beating around the bush, hesitant to investigate the crime scene. Hardy sighed. ‘Come on, let’s cut to the chase.’”\nVerdict: Acceptable but a bit cliché in its use of idioms.\n\n\n\nConclusion &gt;While LLMs have a strong grasp of idiomatic meanings and can recognize idioms in most contexts, their application of idioms in generated text can sometimes feel unnatural. They excel at defining and interpreting idioms but occasionally falter in using them fluidly in storytelling and casual dialogue. Future improvements in contextual learning and training on conversational nuances may help bridge this gap, making AI-generated language even more human-like."
