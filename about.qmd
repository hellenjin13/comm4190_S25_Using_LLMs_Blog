# About This Blog

<div class="highlight">
This blog is a project where I test what large language models can do. I explore topics like AI bias, fitness coaching, horoscope writing, music suggestions, and more — all through casual but thoughtful experiments with GPT4.
</div>

I post from pop culture and mental health to daily life questions and creative prompts. Each post asks a simple question and records how the model responds — the good, the helpful, and the weird.

Thanks for reading.
