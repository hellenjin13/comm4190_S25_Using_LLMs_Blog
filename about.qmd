# 👋 Hi, I’m Hellen

<div class="highlight">
This blog is where I test how well language models like GPT4 can imitate, support, and sometimes surprise us. Every few days, I ask a new question — from "Can it act like a gym buddy?" to "Does it understand horoscopes?" — and post the results here.
</div>

## What You’ll Find Here

🧠 Honest tests of AI behavior  
📅 Posts every two days (give or take)  
🎯 Real prompts, short results, zero fluff  
🌐 Topics like politics, astrology, mental health, playlists, and gym routines

## Why I’m Doing This

LLMs are changing how we search, write, and think. I wanted to explore what they’re actually capable of — not just in theory, but in practice. No hype. Just hands-on experiments.
