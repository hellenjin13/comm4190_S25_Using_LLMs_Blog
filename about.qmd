# About This Blog

<div class="highlight">
This blog explores what large language models can do, and where they fall short. Each post starts with a simple question, like can an LLM write a horoscope or can it act like a gym buddy, and then tests the model's response in real time.
</div>

I document how GPT4 handles everything from fitness routines to political questions, horoscopes to fashion aesthetics. The posts are written with clarity and curiosity, offering a casual but thoughtful look at LLM behavior in everyday life.

Whether you're into AI, digital culture, or just here for the vibe, welcome.
